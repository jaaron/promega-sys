; --- SECTION: TOOLS (TOOL DEFINITION SECTION) --- 

; Comment: H0 is typically heated bed
; Comment: D0 is the first driver after movement drives, which is extruder

; --- SECTION: MISCELLANEOUS --- 

; Comment: POSITIVE S values (in seconds) start extruder before motion system. When set too high there's not enough filamanet left to finish an extrude command, leaving gaps before a croner. NEGATIVE values delay extrusion until after movement has started. Too high leads to gaps after a corner -- AG
